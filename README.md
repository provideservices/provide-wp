# provide-wp

This is a WordPress plugin for managing provide.services implementations in WordPress.

https://provide.services stands up private blockchain networks within hours, not months, giving your team the ability to focus dev time on your use cases instead of platform development.

This plugin works with the provide-php library (https://github.com/web3devs/provide-php) to allow WordPress site owners to interact with their private blockchains on Provide.
